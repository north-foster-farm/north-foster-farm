            <p>
              The past few weeks have presented an unusually long list of
              challenges for us and our hens including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The ongoing nationwide egg shortage.</strong> Reduced
                availability and rising costs have more people than ever
                seeking alternative egg sources. We are receiving many new
                requests for eggs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flock productivity.</strong> Our most senior hens are
                showing their age and producing fewer eggs. Cold temperatures
                also affect production. When hens use additional energy to keep
                warm, it often leads to fewer eggs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Frozen eggs.</strong> Despite collecting our eggs
                several times a day, very cold temperatures can cause some eggs
                to freeze and crack, rendering them unsellable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flock numbers.</strong> Sadly, we have recently lost
                several hens to predation by the local hawk population.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In response, we are making adjustments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Temporary quantity limits.</strong> To ensure we are
                able to provide all of our customers with eggs, we are asking
                that you limit your weekly purchase to <strong>no more than 3
                dozen </strong>until further notice. Hopefully, this will allow
                us to continue to provide eggs to everyone. We are sorry for
                the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>New winter quarters.</strong> Our hens have been moved
                into a new winter home: a 16ʹ × 50ʹ high-tunnel greenhouse.
                Benefits include warmer chickens, warmer eggs, and better
                protection from airborne predators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>New employees.</strong> Bird flu is making new laying
                hens more difficult to find.  Fortunately, we will be receiving
                100 “ready-to-lay” hens in April that aren’t quite ready to
                lay… we expect the new recruits to lay full-size, sellable eggs
                no later than early June.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition to these adjustments, we are also making a big change
              that will make our already high-quality eggs even better.
            </p>
            <h3>Non-GMO transition</h3>
            <p>
              Since we began, we’ve had many requests for {{ $nonGMO }} eggs.
              We believe that transitioning our hens to a non-GMO diet aligns
              with our goal of producing the healthiest and most humane
              {{ $pastureRaised }} eggs we can. As of February 1<sup>st</sup>,
              we will begin feeding our hens non-GMO grain, and when the ground
              has thawed and the snow has melted, they will continue to have
              access to pasture.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this change comes a small increase in cost. <strong>Our
              price will increase 17 cents per egg to $7.00 per dozen,
              beginning February 8<sup>th.</sup></strong> This modest price
              increase will allow us to provide the highest quality product we
              can.

              Our Saturday-morning egg drop schedule will continue through the
              winter months. You will find us at the Scituate Rotary Farmers
              Market site (46 Institute Lane in North Scituate) on Saturdays
              from 10 to 11 AM.

              Changes to our schedule and periodic updates will be posted on

            <h2>We love eggs.</h2>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
              inexpensive eggs, eggs called “free-range”, eggs called
              “cage-free”, and more recently, eggs called “pasture-raised”.
              Some of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually
              learned ghe truth about each of these categories. In fact,
              pasture-raised eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
              night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
              day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air,
              sunshine, and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They
              roam freely in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and
              insects—just like chickens are supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              After about a week, when the “good stuff” begins to dwindle, we
              move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
              fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
              delicious eggs.
