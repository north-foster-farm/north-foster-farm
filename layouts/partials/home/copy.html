            <p>
              I'm sure I say it every year, but <i>I can't believe fall is here
              already.</i> We've had a busy 2025 and the hens have been doing a
              great job providing us with delicious, pasture-raised, non-GMO
              eggs. This method of production does make a difference. Raising
              layers on pasture and moving them to clean grass yields a better
              egg, and provides a healthier, happier environment for the
              chickens. "Certified humane", "free range", "cage free", or
              "organic" may be better than living in a tiny cage in an
              industrial egg factory, but they simply don't compare to
              pasture-raised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our hens live on pasture for most of the year. They still have
              access to the outdoors, but are moved to a high tunnel greenhouse
              for protection from the winter weather. When on pasture, they are
              moved to clean grass regularly and able to supplement their
              non-GMO grain diet with seeds, grasses, legumes, insects and
              worms. They are never fed hormones or antibiotics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Egg production has slowed a bit, partially due to shorter days,
              and partially because our chickens are molting—the time of year
              when hens slow or stop egg production and focus their energy on
              replacing feathers. We'll soon be heading to Pennsylvania to pick
              up 100 new employees. These 16-week-old, ready-to-lay pullets
              (young chickens) will help us keep up with demand during the
              progressively shorter days of winter. As mentioned in previous
              updates, they're called "ready-to-lay", but actually need a few
              additional weeks before they begin to lay their first small eggs.
              Hopefully, they'll be contributing large eggs by the end of
              December. Until then, we only pay them minimum chicken wage.

              The outdoor farmer's market season is winding down. The last day
              of the Scituate Rotary Farmers Market is this Saturday, September
              27<sup>th</sup>. We may be wearing long johns, but the Foster
              Farmer's Market will be hanging on until October 26<sup>th</sup>.
              Even though the markets will close for the winter, our eggs are
              available all year long. We will be offering a weekly egg drop
              off at the site of the Scituate Rotary Farmers Market on Saturday
              mornings from 10 - 11. All you need to do is stop by and purchase
              as usual.

              We're already excited about what's to come in 2026. We've started
              clearing some additional pastures, and as we get closer to the
              new season we'll provide more details. In the meantime, please
              visit {{ $instagram }} to see pictures and videos of our flock in
              action. We also recommend this excellent video from APPPA that
              explains what it means to be pasture raised, and why it's so
              beneficial: {{ $apppaVideo }}

            <h2>We love eggs.</h2>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
              inexpensive eggs, eggs called “free-range”, eggs called
              “cage-free”, and more recently, eggs called “pasture-raised”.
              Some of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually
              learned the truth about each of these categories. In fact,
              pasture-raised eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
              night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
              day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air,
              sunshine, and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They
              roam freely in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and
              insects—just like chickens are supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              After about a week, when the “good stuff” begins to dwindle, we
              move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
              fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
              delicious eggs.
