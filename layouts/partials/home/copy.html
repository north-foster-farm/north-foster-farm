          <p class="fmw-575">
            Due to the unexpected, but greatly appreciated demand for our
            pasture raised eggs we have been selling out fairly early each week
            at the farmers market. We recently doubled the size of our flock,
            but the new recruits won’t be laying sellable eggs for a few more
            weeks.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 pb-4">
            With this in mind we’ve decided to go to an every other
            week schedule for the rest of the season. We look forward to
            seeing you at the Scituate Rotary Farmers Market on the following
            Saturdays:<br><br>
            <span style="padding-left: 10px">• September 14</span><br>
            <span style="padding-left: 10px">• September 28</span><br>
            <span style="padding-left: 10px">• October 5 (the final 2024 market day)</span>
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575">
            Please check back here for updates about how to purchase eggs after
            October 5th until the 2025 market opens.

          <h2 class="fmw-575 text-center">We love eggs.</h2>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            Over the years we've purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
            inexpensive eggs, eggs called "free-range", eggs called "cage-free",
            and more recently, eggs called "pasture-raised". Some of these labels
            sound better than others, but we eventually learned the truth about
            each of these categories. In fact, pasture-raised eggs stand head and
            shoulders above the rest.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At night,
            our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the day, they
            spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air, sunshine, and abundant
            access to clean water and fresh feed. They roam freely in a safe
            enclosure and enjoy grasses and insects—just like chickens are supposed
            to.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            After about a week, when the "good stuff" begins to dwindle, we move
            them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start fresh. As a
            result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy, delicious eggs.
