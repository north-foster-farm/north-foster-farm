              We offer <strong>pasture-raised, non-GMO chicken eggs</strong> by
              the dozen. Stop by our booth to purchase eggs, learn about our
              farm, and find out why we believe pasture-raised chickens lay the
              best eggs.

            <h2>We love eggs.</h2>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
              inexpensive eggs, eggs called “free-range”, eggs called
              “cage-free”, and more recently, eggs called “pasture-raised”.
              Some of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually
              learned the truth about each of these categories. In fact,
              pasture-raised eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
              night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
              day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air,
              sunshine, and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They
              roam freely in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and
              insects—just like chickens are supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              After about a week, when the “good stuff” begins to dwindle, we
              move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
              fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
              delicious eggs.
