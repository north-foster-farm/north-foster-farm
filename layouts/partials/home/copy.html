            The 2024 farmers market season has ended for us, but our eggs are
            still available! You will find us at our Saturday drop site at the
            Scituate Rotary Farmers Market location (46 Institute Lane in North
            Scituate). We will be on site from 10 to 11 AM with fresh eggs.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575">
            Although we have asked our hens to do their best, eggs are limited
            to supply on hand and offered on a first come first served basis.

          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
            inexpensive eggs, eggs called "free-range", eggs called
            "cage-free", and more recently, eggs called "pasture-raised". Some
            of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually learned
            the truth about each of these categories. In fact, pasture-raised
            eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
            night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
            day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air, sunshine,
            and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They roam freely
            in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and insects—just like
            chickens are supposed to.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            After about a week, when the "good stuff" begins to dwindle, we
            move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
            fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
            delicious eggs.
