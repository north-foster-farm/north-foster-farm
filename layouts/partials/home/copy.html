            <p>
              Following a chilly winter, we are very happy that spring has
              officially arrived! The chickens are just as happy and can’t wait
              to get back out on pasture. They have outdoor access, but frozen
              or muddy brown grass just isn’t as appetizing as fresh green
              growth. When they find stray green shoots, they gobble them up.
              Each day brings more green and we anticipate a return to the
              mobile coop and regular moves within a few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few springtime updates to share:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>New employees.</strong> Although Avian Influenza (bird
                flu) has impacted the availability of both chicks and
                ready-to-lay birds, we were fortunate to be able to add to our
                flock. Our new help is on the farm settling in. It will be
                <strong>several weeks before they begin to lay</strong>, but
                we’re looking forward to their delicious eggs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Farmers markets.</strong> The 2025 farmers markets are
                just around the corner. The {{ $scituateFarmersMarket }} opens
                May 10<sup>th</sup>, and the {{ $fosterFarmersMarket }} opens
                June 1<sup>st</sup>. We’re hopeful that our new layers will
                supply enough eggs to allow us to support customers at both
                locations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Non-GMO.</strong> In our last update, we noted that
                based on requests and our desire to offer healthy eggs, we made
                the switch to {{ $nonGMO }} feed. Our existing flock has been on
                non-GMO since just after the start of the year. Our new layers
                were raised on non-GMO and all of our birds are antibiotic and
                hormone free.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pasture-raised.</strong> If you haven’t had an
                opportunity to watch this video produced by APPPA (The American
                Pastured Poultry Producers Association), take a few minutes to
                learn more about the benefits of {{ $pastureRaised }} eggs and
                poultry.

            <h2>We love eggs.</h2>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
              inexpensive eggs, eggs called “free-range”, eggs called
              “cage-free”, and more recently, eggs called “pasture-raised”.
              Some of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually
              learned the truth about each of these categories. In fact,
              pasture-raised eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
              night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
              day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air,
              sunshine, and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They
              roam freely in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and
              insects—just like chickens are supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              After about a week, when the “good stuff” begins to dwindle, we
              move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
              fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
              delicious eggs.
