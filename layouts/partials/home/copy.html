          <h2 class="fmw-575 text-center">We love eggs.</h2>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            Over the years we’ve purchased all kinds of eggs from the store:
            inexpensive eggs, eggs called "free-range", eggs called
            "cage-free", and more recently, eggs called "pasture-raised". Some
            of these labels sound better than others, but we eventually learned
            the truth about each of these categories. In fact, pasture-raised
            eggs stand head and shoulders above the rest.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            At North Foster Farm, we proudly produce pasture-raised eggs. At
            night, our hens are kept inside a secure mobile coop. During the
            day, they spend their time on grass, enjoying fresh air, sunshine,
            and abundant access to clean water and fresh feed. They roam freely
            in a safe enclosure and enjoy grasses and insects—just like
            chickens are supposed to.
          </p>
          <p class="fmw-575 text-center">
            After about a week, when the "good stuff" begins to dwindle, we
            move them (coop and all) to a new spot in the pasture to start
            fresh. As a result, we have happy, healthy hens that lay healthy,
            delicious eggs.
